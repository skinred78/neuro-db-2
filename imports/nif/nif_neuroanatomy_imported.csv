"Brain","","The part of the central nervous system contained within the cranium, comprising the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon. It is derived from the anterior part of the embryonic neural tube.

    * Subdivision of neuraxis that consists of neural tissue (which is organized into gray matter and white matter) and the cerebral ventricular system (cavity of organ part); it is embryologically derived from the rostral part of the neural tube; together with the spinal cord, the brain constitutes the organ neuraxis. Examples: There is only one brain. (UWDA) * That part of the central nervous system contained within the cranium, comprising the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon. It is derived from the anterior part of the embryonic neural tube. Functions include muscle control and coordination, sensory reception and integration, speech production, memory storage, and the elaboration of thought and emotions.

"Telencephalon","","The telencephalon is the name for a large region within the brain that is attributed many functions. Many people refer to it as the cerebrum; however, it is technically referred to as the telencephalon. As a more technical definition, the telencephalon refers to the cerebral hemispheres and other, smaller structures within the brain, although the telencephalon is one of the larger divisions (in terms of number). It is the anterior-most embryological division of the brain that develops from the prosencephalon. The telencephalon is composed of the following sub-regions; Limbic system; Cerebral cortex or cortices of the cerebral hemispheres, Basal ganglia, Olfactory bulb. The telencephalon comprises what most people think of as the ""brain."" It lies on top of the brainstem and is the largest and most well-developed of the five major divisions of the brain. The telencephalon is the newest structure in the phylogenetic sense, with mammals having the largest and most well-developed among all species. It emerges from the prosencephalon, the first of three vesicles that form from the embryonic neural tube (Christine Fennema-Notestine).","","","","","","","","","","","","Regional part of forebrain","","","","","","","","nif","2","nif","2025-11-19"

Its fibers can be traced lateralward and backward on either side beneath the corpus striatum into the substance of the temporal lobe. It serves in this way to connect the two temporal lobes, but it also contains decussating fibers from the olfactory tracts.

"Subventricular Zone","","The subventricular zone (SVZ) is one of two sources of adult-born neurons in the mammalian brain, the other being the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus. In most adult mammals, the SVZ is a three-layered sheath that lies along the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle and consists of type A, B, and C cells. Type A rest along the ventricle wall and are neuronal precursor cells, Type B are adjacent astrocytes, and Type C are immature precursors to the Type A neuroblasts. The neuronal precursor cells travel along the rostral migratory stream ensheathed in a tube of Type B astrocytes, until they reach the olfactory bulb. There they integrate into the existing cellular network and mature into local interneurons. While the majority become adult-born granule cells, a subset become periglomerular cells. Interestingly, the human SVZ differs from other mammals' in several ways. It consists of four layers rather than three: ependymal cells (layer I), a hypo cellular gap (layer II), a ribbon of astrocytes (layer III), and a transitional zone (layer IV). The astrocytes are capable of differentiating into many kinds of tissue including new neurons. However, there is no evidence that the proliferating neurons travel along the rostral migratory stream in a chain to populate the olfactory bulb with new interneurons, as is the case for other mammals.","","","","","","","","","","","","Regional part of brain","","","","","","","","nif","2","nif","2025-11-19"

"Prefrontal cortex","","The anterior part of the frontal lobes of the brain, lying in front of the motor and premotor areas.

This brain region has been implicated in planning complex cognitive behaviors, personality expression, decision making and moderating correct social behavior. The basic activity of this brain region is considered to be orchestration of thoughts and actions in accordance with internal goals.

The most typical psychological term for functions carried out by the pre-frontal cortex area is executive function. Executive function relates to abilities to differentiate among conflicting thoughts, determine good and bad, better and best, same and different, future consequences of current activities, working toward a defined goal, prediction of outcomes, expectation based on actions, and social ""control"" (the ability to suppress urges that, if not suppressed, could lead to socially-unacceptable outcomes).

Many authors have indicated an integral link between a person's personality and the functions of the prefrontal cortex. - definition adapted from Wikipedia","","","","","","","","","","","","Gross anatomical part of cerebral cortex","","","","","","","","nif","2","nif","2025-11-19"

"Olfactory system","","The sensory system used for olfaction, or the sense of smell. Most mammals and reptiles have two distinct parts to their olfactory system: a main olfactory system and an accessory olfactory system. The main olfactory system detects volatile, airborne substances, while the accessory olfactory system senses fluid-phase stimuli. Behavioral evidence indicates that most often, the stimuli detected by the accessory olfactory system are pheromones.

The olfactory system is often spoken of along with the gustatory system as the chemosensory senses because both transduce chemical signals into perception. - definition adapted from Wikipedia","","","","","","","","","","","","Neural system","","","","","","","","nif","2","nif","2025-11-19"

In three dimensions, they form a 3D labyrinth extending throughout the caudate nucleus and in the putamen.","","","","","","","","","","","","Chemoarchitectural part of neostriatum","","","","","","","","nif","2","nif","2025-11-19"
