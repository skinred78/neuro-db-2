## 6. Recommendations

*To be added after manual review of sampled terms*

**Next Steps**:
1. Review sampled terms for neuroscience relevance
2. Assess whether low-coverage sources should be excluded
3. Consider prioritizing high-coverage sources (MSH, SNOMEDCT_US)
4. Decide: proceed as-is, filter to definitions-only, or hybrid approach
