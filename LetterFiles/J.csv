Jacksonian seizure,,"A focal seizure that begins in one part of the body (e.g., hand or face) and spreads progressively to adjacent body parts, following the organization of the motor cortex. Named after neurologist John Hughlings Jackson.","Epilepsies, Partial",focal motor seizure,Jacksonian march,,,,,seizure,,,,epilepsy,motor cortex,focal seizure,somatotopy,partial seizure,seizure progression,John Hughlings Jackson,
James-Lange theory,,"A theory of emotion proposing that emotions arise from the perception of physiological responses to stimuli, rather than the other way around. For example, we feel sad because we cry, rather than crying because we feel sad.",Emotions,,,,,,,,,,,emotion,physiological response,perception,autonomic response,William James,Carl Lange,theory of emotion,
Jaw jerk reflex,,A brainstem reflex in which tapping the chin causes contraction of the masseter muscle and elevation of the mandible. Used clinically to assess the function of cranial nerve V (trigeminal nerve) and brainstem integrity.,Reflex,mandibular reflex,masseter reflex,,,,,reflex,,,,trigeminal nerve,brainstem,cranial nerve V,masseter muscle,neurological examination,reflex testing,,
