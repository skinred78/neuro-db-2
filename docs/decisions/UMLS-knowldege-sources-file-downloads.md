We are considering a new approach to generating UMLS subsets, and we would like your feedback. The new approach may involve producing new precomputed subsets or configuring subsets in a web browser instead of in MetamorphoSys. We are interested in knowing which features of MetamorphoSys our users consider essential. Please submit your comments to the [NLM Help Desk](https://support.nlm.nih.gov/support/create-case/) using the subject line: “UMLS Subsets”
