====================================================================================================
SECTION 2: INCORRECT MESH TERMS REQUIRING CORRECTION (5 terms)
====================================================================================================

The following MeSH terms were NOT FOUND in the official NIH MeSH database and require correction.
Each has been researched and a verified alternative MeSH term is provided.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. BINOCULAR RIVALRY (B.csv, Row 9)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Current MeSH (INCORRECT): Vision Binocular
   Status: ✗ NOT FOUND in MeSH database

   Recommended MeSH: Depth Perception
   Verification: ✓ VERIFIED in MeSH database

   Alternative options:
     • Stereopsis
     • Vision
     • Visual Perception

   Rationale: "Vision Binocular" is not a valid MeSH descriptor. "Depth Perception" is the
   most appropriate MeSH term for binocular vision-related concepts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. BROCA'S APHASIA (B.csv, Row 23)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Current MeSH (INCORRECT): Broca Aphasia
   Status: ✗ NOT FOUND in MeSH database

   Recommended MeSH: Aphasia
   Verification: ✓ VERIFIED in MeSH database

   Alternative options:
     • Language Disorders
     • Speech Disorders

   Rationale: While "Broca Aphasia" appears in search results, it is not an exact MeSH
   descriptor. The broader term "Aphasia" is the correct MeSH heading.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. CEREBRAL HEMISPHERE (C.csv, Row 8)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Current MeSH (INCORRECT): Cerebral Hemisphere
   Status: ✗ NOT FOUND in MeSH database

   Recommended MeSH: Cerebrum
   Verification: ✓ VERIFIED in MeSH database

   Alternative options:
     • Brain
     • Telencephalon

   Rationale: "Cerebral Hemisphere" is not a MeSH descriptor. "Cerebrum" is the most specific
   and appropriate MeSH term for this anatomical structure.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. CHROMATOLYSIS (C.csv, Row 13)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Current MeSH (INCORRECT): Chromatolysis
   Status: ✗ NOT FOUND in MeSH database

   Recommended MeSH: Nerve Degeneration
   Verification: ✓ VERIFIED in MeSH database

   Rationale: "Chromatolysis" is not a standalone MeSH descriptor. "Nerve Degeneration" is
   the appropriate MeSH term that encompasses this pathological process.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. CROSS MODAL PLASTICITY (C.csv, Row 27)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Current MeSH (INCORRECT): Cross-modal plasticity
   Status: ✗ NOT FOUND in MeSH database

   Recommended MeSH: Neuronal Plasticity
   Verification: ✓ VERIFIED in MeSH database

   Alternative options:
     • Sensory Deprivation (related concept)

   Rationale: "Cross-modal plasticity" is not a MeSH descriptor. "Neuronal Plasticity" is
   the appropriate broader MeSH term that includes cross-modal plasticity phenomena.


====================================================================================================
SECTION 3: REQUIRED CORRECTIONS - ACTION ITEMS
====================================================================================================

The following changes must be made to the CSV files:

FILE: /Users/sam/NeuroDB-2/B.csv
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Row 9 - Binocular rivalry
  CHANGE: "Vision Binocular" → "Depth Perception"

Row 23 - Broca's aphasia
  CHANGE: "Broca Aphasia" → "Aphasia"


FILE: /Users/sam/NeuroDB-2/C.csv
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Row 8 - Cerebral hemisphere
  CHANGE: "Cerebral Hemisphere" → "Cerebrum"

Row 13 - Chromatolysis
  CHANGE: "Chromatolysis" → "Nerve Degeneration"

Row 27 - Cross modal plasticity
  CHANGE: "Cross-modal plasticity" → "Neuronal Plasticity"


====================================================================================================
SECTION 4: VALIDATION METHODOLOGY
====================================================================================================

Validation Process:
1. Each MeSH term was queried against the NIH MeSH API using exact match
   Endpoint: https://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/lookup/descriptor?label={term}&match=exact

2. Terms returning valid JSON responses with descriptor data were marked as VERIFIED

3. Terms returning 404 or empty responses were marked as NOT_FOUND

4. For NOT_FOUND terms, comprehensive searches were conducted using:
   - Partial matching
   - Related keyword searches
   - Alternative formulations

5. All recommended corrections were re-validated against the MeSH API to ensure accuracy

Quality Assurance:
  ✓ All 43 verified terms confirmed in official MeSH database
  ✓ All 5 recommended corrections confirmed in official MeSH database
  ✓ Zero validation errors encountered
  ✓ 100% of terms processed successfully
