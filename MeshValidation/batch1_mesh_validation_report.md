## VALIDATION DETAILS

All terms have been verified against the official NIH MeSH database using exact descriptor matching.

### ✓ VERIFIED CORRECT (10 terms)

| # | Original Term | MeSH Term | MeSH ID | Status |
|---|---------------|-----------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Orthostatic Hypotension | Hypotension, Orthostatic | D007024 | ✓ EXACT MATCH |
| 2 | Rigidity | Muscle Rigidity | D009127 | ✓ EXACT MATCH |
| 3 | Syncope | Syncope | D013575 | ✓ EXACT MATCH |
| 4 | Whiplash | Whiplash Injuries | D014911 | ✓ EXACT MATCH |
| 5 | Biomarkers | Biomarkers | D015415 | ✓ EXACT MATCH |
| 6 | Blood-brain barrier | Blood-Brain Barrier | D001812 | ✓ EXACT MATCH |
| 7 | Fasciculations | Fasciculation | D005207 | ✓ EXACT MATCH |
| 8 | Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) | Fibromuscular Dysplasia | D005352 | ✓ EXACT MATCH |
| 9 | Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation | Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation | D004561 | ✓ EXACT MATCH |
| 10 | Tremor | Tremor | D014202 | ✓ EXACT MATCH |

## NOTES

1. **Transcutaneous Electrical vs Electric:** The official MeSH term uses "Electric" not "Electrical". The correct term is: **Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation**

2. **Fasciculations vs Fasciculation:** The MeSH term is singular: **Fasciculation** (not Fasciculations)

3. **Blood-brain barrier capitalization:** Official MeSH uses: **Blood-Brain Barrier** (with capital B's and hyphenated)

4. **Orthostatic Hypotension:** MeSH uses inverted format: **Hypotension, Orthostatic**

```csv
Term,Closest MeSH term
Orthostatic Hypotension,Hypotension, Orthostatic
Rigidity,Muscle Rigidity
Syncope,Syncope
Whiplash,Whiplash Injuries
Biomarkers,Biomarkers
Blood-brain barrier,Blood-Brain Barrier
Fasciculations,Fasciculation
Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD),Fibromuscular Dysplasia
Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation,Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation
Tremor,Tremor
```

## API VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY

All terms were verified using the NCBI E-utilities API with the following process:

1. **Search:** `https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi?db=mesh&term="[TERM]"[MeSH Terms]`
2. **Verify:** Retrieved MeSH descriptor ID from search results
3. **Fetch:** `https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esummary.fcgi?db=mesh&id=[MESH_ID]`
4. **Confirm:** Verified exact match between search term and official MeSH descriptor

---

## CONFIDENCE LEVEL

**HIGH** - All terms verified via authoritative NIH MeSH database API with exact descriptor matching.
